# Movie Display Website

This is created to help me learn full stack development using python. This is a website to display the movies I like. This website is written by **Python 3**.

To install Python3:
- [Windows](https://docs.python.org/3/using/windows.html#installing-python)
- [Mac](https://docs.python.org/3/using/mac.html)
- [Linux](https://docs.python.org/3/using/unix.html)

The html page is dynamically generated from a Python data structure. The movie data contains ``` title, movie_storyline, poster_image, trailer_youtube```
